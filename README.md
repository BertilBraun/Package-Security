## Issues

- Slow Detections:
  - --- 0.6540 seconds --- FACES ---
  - --- 0.9339 seconds --- BOXES ---
  
- Faces sometimes faces get detected as boxes
- Box detection is misserable for every frame to get the same bounding boxes


## TODO

 - [x] Face Detection
 - [x] Face Comparison
 - [x] Packet Detection
 - [x] Text to Speach
